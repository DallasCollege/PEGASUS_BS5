    <h2>New Process for PDFs</h2>
    <p>Because of our Accessibility mandate and to ensure a better experience for all users, the new PDF process, as it applies to the flagship Dallas College website (www.dallascollege.edu), is as follows:</></p>
    <h3>Requirements for Submission</h3>
    <p>The client must provide:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the PDF file</li>
        <li>a Word document file that contains all the text/copy of the PDF file. Word doc must be accessible with headings and basic styling. See <a href="https:/www.dallascollege.edu/accessibility/">Accessibility Guidelines</a>.</li>
        <li>a ZIP file containing any and all source graphics/images (with the exception of Dallas College logos) used in the PDF file.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>If the document is a <strong>form</strong>:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If the form requires <strong>a physical signature or asks for <a href="https://www.dallascollege.edu/about/legal/ipsp/pages/default.aspx#confidential">Category 3</a> information</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li>Make PDF a fillable, accessible document via Adobe Acrobat (Turnaround time: approx. 10 days)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If the form only asks for <strong><a href="https://www.dallascollege.edu/about/legal/ipsp/pages/default.aspx#public">Category 1</a> or <a href="https://www.dallascollege.edu/about/legal/ipsp/pages/default.aspx#internal">Category 2</a> information</strong>:<br />
            <ul>
                <li>Convert PDF to an online form via MS Forms through our <a href="https://dcccd.sharedwork.com/wz/template/pubprojrequest,RequestProject.vm?form=4866110243">Forms Process</a> (Turnaround time: approx. 10 days)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>If the document is simply&nbsp;<strong>a means of delivering content:</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Use Word doc and attached images to convert/reconstruct document as an accessible web page and include a link to the PDF for printing purposes only (Turnaround time: approx. 5 days)</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="alert alert-success">
        <h3>We prioritize PDF requests that:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Come from the Chancellor, Executive Vice Chancellor of Operations or the Chief Marketing Officer.</li>
            <li>Are critical to student admission, registration or financial aid.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="alert alert-danger">
        <h3>We will not post PDFs that:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Have been created by third parties or entites outside of Dallas College</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 id="naming">Naming PDF or Word Documents</h2>
    <p>We have developed a naming convention (in addition to our guidelines for naming pages/sites/files) to help us easily identify PDF or Word documents:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If the document has been made accessible, append the filename with <code>-ada</code> before the extension</li>
        <li>If the document is an approved printable alternative to other content that is already accessible (like a web page), append the filename with <code>-print</code> before the extension</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Storing PDF and Word Documents</h2>
    <p>We are storing approved and accessible PDF and Word documents in a single directory (as opposed to different subsites in different areas). The storage place for these files is:</p>
    <pre><a href="https://wwws.dallascollege.edu/SiteCollectionDocuments/Forms/AllItems.aspx?FolderCTID=0x01200095A0F308868C754EA4480EF6E4825C0D&id=%2FSiteCollectionDocuments%2Fdocs">https://wwws.dallascollege.edu/sitecollectiondocuments/docs/</a></pre>
    <p>From there, the folder structure follows the structure of the site as a whole. For example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>For pages under <code>/about/legal/</code>, the corresponding PDF storage directory would be <code>/sitecollectiondocuments/docs/about/legal/</code>. And so forth.</li>
    </ul>
